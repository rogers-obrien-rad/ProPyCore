# Changelog

## 0.5.4 - 2025-02-06

### Added
* `time.timecard`: create `get_for_specified_period()` method to get timecards for a specified period and `party_id`
* `time.timecard`: create `update()` method to patch timecards given their ID and date
* `time.timesheets`: create to house endpoints with "timesheet" specified within them - pulled in functions originally in `time.timecard`

### Changed
* `time.timecard`: change `create_in_project()` to simply `create()` since Procore Developer Support said that using the company-based or project-based timecard endpoint produced the same result
* `tools`: wrap all previous examples into notebook called `generic_tools.ipynb`

### Removed
* `time.timecard`: remove endpoints with "timesheet" 
* `tools`: remove old Python example files
